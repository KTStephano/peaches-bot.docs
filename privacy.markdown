The Peaches website does not collect any personal information or data. 

The Peaches bot stores information such as:

- Guild data: ID, boost count
- Channel data: channel ID
- Role data: role ID
- Message data: message ID
- Member data: user ID, per-guild boost status
- Trivia win/loss data
- Any user supplied content given during interactions with the bot's custom commands feature

All data is stored within the context of a guild. If a guild's data is deleted, everything goes with it including channel IDs, role IDs, user IDs, user supplied content, etc.

Data is only retained for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service from the bot. Once data has been unused for 7 days, it is automatically deleted.

# Why is this data collected?

The sole purpose of collecting this data is to enable the bot to function and to diagnose bot issues (crashes, slowdowns).

# Is this data shared or sold?

None of the data collected by the bot is shared or sold to any 3rd party. The only exception is cases where required by law.

# How is this data protected?

Steps have been taken to prevent unauthorized access to data in the database.

# Can I request data be deleted?

Yes.

If you are a guild owner or administrator (acting on behalf of the guild owner), you can join the official Peaches Discord support server and make a request to have all data associated with your guild deleted.

If you are a regular user, you can join the official Peaches Discord support server and request that data associated with your User ID be deleted.

# How is payment data handled?

All payments submitted for the purchase of Premium bot features is handled by 3rd party payment processors. Data submitted to those 3rd parties (real name, address, phone number, credit card info, etc.) is governed by the privacy policies of those 3rd parties. Peaches does not, at any point, have access to that data or have responsibility for its safe keeping.

# What if you have questions regarding your personal data?

You can join the official Peaches Discord support server so that you can talk to the bot owner.
