# Programmable Stages

There are two stages that can be programmed. 

The first is the **command creation** stage. This will only be run when the command is first being created. It allows you to write code that sets the command's various input options and their choices as well as its default permissions. If you later need to change the command setup (name, description, options), you will need to re-run this step. Changing permissions can be done for any command from inside of Server Settings > Integrations > Peaches.

The second is the **trigger execution** stage. There are multiple types of triggers, one of them being a slash command being entered by a user.

# Context

When the **trigger execution** stage is run, it is initialized with a context that informs the code about what triggered it. This can include information about the guild, member, channel, etc. It can be retrieved through the `context` builtin variable.

Retrieves a single database entry represented by id, key pair. ID should be an int64 type whereas key should be a String type.

### dbGetMultiple id limit

Retrieves up to `limit` entries from the database where the id matches. Key is not taken into account at all.

### dbSet id key data

Sets a single database entry represented by id, key pair to be data. ID should be an int64 type whereas key should be a String type.

Keep in mind that by default, all integer types are converted to floating point by the DB manager and time types are converted to string. For this reason, if you are trying to store something like an ID which is an int64, convert it to a string first.

There are conversion functions `toInt64`, `toFloat64`, `toString`, `toTime` you can use for data you retrieve from the database.

### dbSetExpire id key data expireAfter

This is the same as `dbSet`, except it takes an expireAfter argument measured in seconds. After that entry has gone out of scope (expired), calls to `dbGet` with that ID-Key pair will return nil.

Creates a webhook response to either a slash command or message component interaction. Message can be either String, Embed or MessageComplex.

### respondEphemeral message

**Note** This only works in slash commands.

This is conceptually the same as `respond` except it shows a message to the user that only they can see and only they can dismiss.

### deleteResponse

### responseID

For a non-ephemeral response, this will return the ID of the message that Discord created.

### mute userID reason duration

Mutes userID for reason for given duration.

### unmute userID

### ban userID reason daysToDelete

Marks a thread as unlocked. `threadID` should not refer to an archived thread.

### exec function data (delay)

Executes a trigger from the Function category. `function` should be the name of the function as a string (case sensitive). `data` can contain information you want to pass to the function which will get placed into its `context.ExecData` entry. `delay` is optional and can be left out. It is measured in seconds, with a max of 60.

If delay is either left out or not specified, exec calls the function immediately and returns whatever the function returns (if anything). Otherwise it schedules it to run and returns empty (nil).

### schedUnique function key delayMinutes

This is a premium feature. Executes a trigger from the Function category after `delayMinutes` have passed. The functions are unique by `key` (type: string, case sensitive). These functions will only execute once, and calling `schedUnique` with the same key twice will cancel the first one. In addition, bot restarts will preserve these scheduled functions.

Delay in minutes must be between 1 and 10080.

### createRole role

Creates a new role. `role` should be a [RoleInfo](/docs/#type-roleinfo) object.

### editRoleName roleID newName

Edits the role specified by `roleID` to be named `newName`.

### editRoleColor roleID color

Edits the role specified by `roleID` to be `color`, which should be a decimal (not hex). Use `hexToInt` for quick conversion to decimal.

### moveRoleAfter roleID afterID

Moves the role specified by `roleID` to come after the role specified by `afterID` in the Discord role hierarchy.

### moveRoleBefore roleID beforeID

Moves the role specified by `roleID` to come before the role specified by `beforeID` in the Discord role hierarchy.

### deleteRole roleID

Deletes role specified by `roleID`.

### createChannel channel

`channel` should be of type [TextChannel](/docs/#type-textchannel). Creates a new channel and returns a Discord Channel object upon success (empty if not).

### deleteChannel channelID

Deletes channel represented by `channelID`.

### setChannelName channelID name

Overwrites the specified channel's name with `name`.

### setChannelTopic channelID topic

Overwrites the specified channel's topic with `topic`.

### editChannelPermissions channelID permissions

Performs an edit of the specified channel's permissions. `permissions` should be an Array of [PermissionOverwrite](/docs/#type-permissionoverwrite).

If a permission in the array is already present in the channel's permissions, it is overwritten with the new values.

If a permission in the array is not already present in the channel's permissions, it is added.

### setChannelPermissions channelID permissions

Overwrites all existing channel permissions by setting them to `permissions`. `permissions` should be an Array of [PermissionOverwrite](/docs/#type-permissionoverwrite).

This has the effect of deleting existing channel permissions not present in the array, overwriting the ones that are, and adding the ones that aren't.

### ignoreBots

This is only needed for guilds that run a private custom instance of the bot. It ends execution early if the triggering event was bot-generated.

### downloadAttachment attachment

**Note:** Only bots listed as privileged can run this.

`attachment1` should be of type *discordgo.MessageAttachment. The bot will attempt to download the attachment and return a *discordgo.File if it succeeded. This can then be used with [MessageComplex](/docs#type-messagecomplex) to send it to a channel.
